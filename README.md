# GoldenSmiles

An iOS work in progress:

GoldenSmiles aims to minimize the barriers in connecting individuals with disabilities. I embolden you to use this platform to build genuine, compassionate friendships that last a lifetime. In every part of my life, whether I have been starting at a new school, or moving to a new place, I have wondered who I will be friends with. I hope that GoldenSmiles can eliminate some of that stress for your and help you find someone to call your best friend. Remember, everyone deserves a friend and everyone has their quirks. By finding people who accept us and these quirks, we have the ability to build truly incredible friendships. So go forth, be proud of who you are, and never be afraid to show off those quirks.
